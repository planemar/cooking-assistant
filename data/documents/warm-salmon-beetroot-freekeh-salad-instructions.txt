How to Make Warm Salmon Beetroot Freekeh Salad - Step by Step Instructions

Complete cooking instructions for making Warm Salmon Beetroot Freekeh Salad:

METHOD:

Step 1:
Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C fan / gas mark 7. Peel and chop beetroot into bite sized chunks. Toss in a little olive oil and salt, and roast until tender – about 30mins. If you have bunched beetroot, wash and chop the stalks and leaves from one beetroot – add these to the roasting dish for a further 5-7 mins, along with the beetroot chunks.

Step 2:
Cook the freekeh in boiling salted water for 10-12mins, or until tender. Drain well.

Step 3:
Line a baking tray with paper and place the salmon fillets skin side up, pat dry, drizzle with a little oil, and sprinkle with a little sea salt. Roast in the oven for 7-8mins, or until the flesh flakes easily. You can discard the skin if you prefer.

Step 4:
To make the dressing, mix the creme fraiche, capers, lemon juice, pinch of salt and pepper, and 1 tbsp of water in a small dish. Add a little more water if needed to make a drizzle-able consistency.

Step 5:
Toss the warm beetroot, beetroot stalks, freekeh, and rocket together. Divide between bowls, top with a salmon fillet, and drizzle with the dressing.
