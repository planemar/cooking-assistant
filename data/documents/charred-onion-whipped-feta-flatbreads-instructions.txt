How to Make Charred Onion & Whipped Feta Flatbreads - Step by Step Instructions

Complete cooking instructions for making Charred Onion & Whipped Feta Flatbreads:

METHOD:

Step 1:
Combine the flour, 1 tsp salt and the yeast in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre, and tip in 150ml warm water and the olive oil. Mix until combined, then knead on a lightly floured surface for 10 mins. Tip into a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise for at least 1 hr, or until doubled in size.

Step 2:
Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a frying pan over a high heat, and fry the onions for about 5 mins until beginning to char, stirring every so often. Tip the onions into a roasting tin with the thyme and honey. Roast for 15 mins until softened.

Step 3:
Crumble the feta into a bowl with the yogurt, then whisk until smooth and creamy.

Step 4:
Heat a dry frying pan over a medium heat. Divide the dough into four to six balls and roll out each into a 1cm-thick circle on a lightly floured surface. Fry, one at a time, for 2 mins on each side until cooked through and lightly charred. Top with the feta yogurt, harissa, roasted onions, a bit of extra thyme and honey, and a pinch of sea salt.

NOTES:
- Grill off some chicken breast and add this with the onion and whipped feta.
