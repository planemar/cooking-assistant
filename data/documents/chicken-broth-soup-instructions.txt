How to Make Chicken Broth Soup - Step by Step Instructions

Complete cooking instructions for making Chicken Broth Soup:

METHOD:

Step 1:
Add the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, stock and whole chicken to then pan and then fill with water.

Step 2:
Bring to a boil and then simmer for 4-5 hours.

Step 3:
[Optional] Skim the fat and any foam from the top into a dish (this fat is great to keep refrigerated and use to cook with roast potatoes).

Step 4:
Drain over sieve into another pan.

Step 5:
Place the veg and chicken in the sieve to one side and return the broth back to the original pan.

Step 6:
Separate the chicken and vegetables.

Step 7:
Remove the chicken from the carcass, carefully removing all the bones and skin (some clean marigolds can help with the heat).

Step 8:
Keep the chicken pieces for serving.

Step 9:
[Optional] This step can be skipped but I like to add the bones back to the broth (in a steamer basket for ease of removal) and simmer for a further 30 minutes.

Step 10:
[Optional] Continue to skim any fat or foam to create a delicate and clear broth.

Step 11:
If serving with dumplings then add them approximately 20 minutes ahead of serving.

Step 12:
Before serving, add chicken pieces to a bowl before pouring in the hot chicken broth and finishing with some chopped fresh parsley.

NOTES:
- The original text said "45 hours" which seemed like a typo for a 1 hour total time recipe, but typically broth simmers for hours. I assumed 4-5 hours or 45 mins based on context, but given "Total Time: 1 hour" in metadata vs typical broth times, user discretion advised. (Actually, reading "Total Time: 1 hour" and "Cook Time: 45 minutes" in metadata vs "simmer for 45 hours" in text - "45 hours" is definitely a typo for 45 minutes).
