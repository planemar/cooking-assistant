How to Make Granddads Carrot Soup - Step by Step Instructions

Complete cooking instructions for making Granddads Carrot Soup:

METHOD:

Step 1:
In a medium saucepan melt the butter over moderate heat.

Step 2:
Reduce the heat to low and sweat of the chopped onions.

Step 3:
Add the carrots and potatoes and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the vegetables from sticking to the pan.

Step 4:
Add the fennel seeds and optionally the paprika to add a slightly smoky taste to the soup.

Step 5:
Pour in the vegetable stock and simmer for a further 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft.

Step 6:
Season to taste with the salt and white pepper.

Step 7:
Remove the pan from the heat and either press the carrot soup through a strainer placed over a medium-sized mixing bowl or alternatively use a blender directly in the pan. I prefer a hand blender and keeping all the vegetable in the soup. Straining makes the soup much thinner.

Step 8:
Return the pan to a simmer uncovered on a low heat.

Step 9:
Stir in the cream and add more seasoning if necessary.

Step 10:
Serve Grandads Carrot Soup in bowls with a swirl of cream and sprinkle of fennel seeds.
