How to Make Tandoori Chicken - Step by Step Instructions

Complete cooking instructions for making authentic tandoori chicken at home:

PREPARATION STEPS:

Step 1 - Make the marinade:
Mix all dry spices together first (turmeric, chilli powder, tandoori masala, cumin, coriander, paprika, pepper, citrus powder). Then add the yoghurt, grated ginger, crushed garlic, and lemon juice. Mix thoroughly until well combined.

Step 2 - Add coloring (optional):
Gradually add red food colouring to achieve the classic tandoori appearance. This is optional but creates the authentic restaurant-style look.

Step 3 - Marinate the chicken:
Place chicken pieces in a large bowl or zip-lock bag. Pour the marinade over and ensure every piece is thoroughly coated. Refrigerate for 24-36 hours for best results - this extended marination time allows the spices to penetrate deeply and the yogurt to tenderize the meat.

COOKING METHOD:

Step 4 - Preheat oven:
Heat your pizza oven, tandoor, or regular oven with cast iron dish to high temperature (around 450-500°F / 230-260°C).

Step 5 - Initial cooking:
Remove chicken from marinade using tongs and place in the preheated cast iron dish. You should hear an immediate sizzle - this sears the outside and locks in flavor. Cook for 3-4 minutes without moving.

Step 6 - Flip and continue:
Turn the chicken pieces over and cook for another 3-4 minutes until nicely charred.

Step 7 - Add onions and finish:
Add the quartered onions to the pan, drizzle with oil, and place chicken on top. Cook for 2-3 more minutes until onions are charred and chicken is fully cooked (internal temp 165°F / 74°C).

Step 8 - Serve:
Serve hot directly in the cast iron dish on a wooden board. The presentation and sizzling sound enhance the dining experience.

COOKING TIPS:
- Don't skip the long marination - it's crucial for tender, flavorful chicken
- High heat is essential for the characteristic char
- If using a regular oven, broil for the last few minutes for extra char
- Can also cook on outdoor grill for smoky flavor
