How to Make Meatballs - Step by Step Instructions

Complete cooking instructions for making Meatballs:

METHOD:

Step 1:
Preheat the oven to 220°C.

Step 2:
Cook off the onions and garlic in some butter and set aside to cool.

Step 3:
Once cool, mix the beef, eggs and onions together in a bowl.

Step 4:
Combine the rest of the ingredients and mix into a pate.

Step 5:
With wet hands roll into golf-ball like sized balls and place on a baking tray.

Step 6:
Optionally brown off the meatballs in a pan to give them a crispy edge - I don't as I prefer a softer meatball.

Step 7:
Cook the meatballs in the pre-heated oven for 18 minutes. No opening to peek but don't over cook them. Remember we want a moist centre.

Step 8:
While the meatballs are cooking prepare the sauce and spaghetti.

SAUCE AND SPAGHETTI METHOD:
Step 9:
Cook the spaghetti as per the packets instructions.

Step 10:
For the sauce, cook off the remaining onions and garlic in some butter.

Step 11:
Once the onions have browned off, add the tomato puree and basil and cook for a further 3 minutes.

Step 12:
Add the can of tomatoes and balsamic vinegar and simmer to reduce for 15 minutes.

Step 13:
Serve the drained spaghetti, pour over some of the sauce and top with the meatballs and a grating of fresh parmesan cheese.
