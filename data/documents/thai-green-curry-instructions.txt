Step 1:
Heat the oils in a large heavy bottom pan and stir in the curry paste for 1-2 minutes. Careful the heat is not too hot that it burns the curry paste.

Step 2:
Add the coconut milk, lime leaves, palm sugar, fish sauce, lime juice, zest and simmer for 10-15 minutes. This is the points where you can add more green curry paste or coconut milk depending on your preference. If I add more of both I often add a little more palm sugar and lime.

Complete the sauce by adding the chilli's, aubergine and bamboo shoots.

Boil water and add sticky rice following the cooking instructions on the packet.
