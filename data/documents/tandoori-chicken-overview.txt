WHAT IS TANDOORI CHICKEN:
Tandoori chicken is a popular Indian dish where chicken pieces are marinated in a spiced yogurt mixture and grilled at high heat. The yogurt tenderizes the chicken while the spice blend (tandoori masala, cumin, coriander, turmeric) creates the signature flavor. Traditional cooking uses a clay tandoor oven, but a pizza oven or grill works well too.

SERVING: Pairs perfectly with naan bread, rice, and mint chutney.
