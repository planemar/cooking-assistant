How to Make Lamb Rogan Josh - Step by Step Instructions

Complete cooking instructions for making Lamb Rogan Josh:

METHOD:

Step 1:
Mix together the yogurt, saffron, ginger paste and garlic paste.

Step 2:
Add the lamb and season to taste.

Step 3:
Cover clingfilm and leave to marinade in the fridge for a few hours. But remember to bring the lamb to room temperature before cooking.

Step 4:
Pound the whole spices with a pestle and mortar to release the oils.

Step 5:
Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan then add the pounded spices and stir until the spices crackle.

Step 6:
Add the finely chopped onions immediately after the spices crackle to stop them from burning.

Step 7:
The trick to creating a great Rogan Josh is to cook the onions until they have absorbed the spices and they're a deep brown.

Step 8:
Stir and cook until the onions are golden brown.

Step 9:
Add the lamb with the marinade to the pan and cook until the meat is browned but not cooked through.

Step 10:
It might stick to the pan but don't worry. Keep stirring and scraping the pan to develop the flavours. You can add a splash of water or lamb stock if the mixture becomes too dry.

Step 11:
Add all the powdered spices and cook for further 5 minutes.

Step 12:
Serve garnished with coriander and thin shreds of ginger.
