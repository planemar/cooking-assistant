Complete cooking instructions for making Haggis & Tatties:

HAGGIS METHOD:
Step 1:
Follow the instructions on the Haggis you’ve chosen for your meal.

NEEPS AND TATTIES METHOD:
Step 2:
Fill both saucepans half full of water, adding a pinch of salt to both.

Step 3:
Peel the potatoes and swede.

Step 4:
Chop the potatoes roughly into quarters and the Swede into small cubes.

Step 5:
Once the water is boiling add the potatoes to one pan and the swede to the other.

Step 6:
Boil for 20-30mins or until you can easily slide a knife into either.

Step 7:
Drain the potatoes, season and allow them to release any steam.

Step 8:
Drain the neeps and also allow to steam.

Step 9:
Add 50g Butter and 50g Milk to the potatoes.

Step 10:
Mash potatoes until creamy and all lumps have been removed.

Step 11:
Taste for seasoning, stir more in if required.

Step 12:
Add 50g butter to the Swede and roughly mash, leaving some rough texture to balance the creamy texture of the potatoes.

Step 13:
Serve both while hot with the haggis.

ASSEMBLY METHOD (STACK):
Step 14:
Place your ring on the plate you wish to serve on.

Step 15:
Add a layer of haggis, filling roughly a third of the ring or 1 inch.

Step 16:
Push down on the haggis using the back of a spoon to make sure it’s firm.

Step 17:
Repeat this with the neeps and then the tatties.

Step 18:
Carefully slide off the ring, using the back of your spoon to ease the ring up without losing the shape of the stack.
